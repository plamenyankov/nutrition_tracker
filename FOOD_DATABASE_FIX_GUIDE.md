# Food Database Edit/Delete Fix Guide

## Problem Description
The Food Database page (`/foods`) had non-functional edit and delete buttons. The new blueprint structure was missing these essential features that existed in the old food blueprint.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Food Service
Added new methods to `models/services/food_service.py`:
- `add_food()` - Create new food entries
- `update_food()` - Edit existing food nutrition values
- `delete_food()` - Remove food from database
- `get_food_details()` - Retrieve specific food information

### 2. New Blueprint Routes
Added routes to `models/blueprints/food_bp.py`:
- `POST /foods/add` - Add new food
- `GET /foods/get/<food_id>` - Get food details
- `POST /foods/update/<food_id>` - Update food
- `POST /foods/delete/<food_id>` - Delete food

### 3. UI Enhancements
Updated `templates/nutrition_app/food_database.html`:

#### Add Food Modal
- Complete form with all nutrition fields including fiber
- Auto-saves to database and refreshes page

#### Edit Food Modal
- Pre-populates with current food values
- Food name and unit are read-only (to maintain data integrity)
- Auto-calculates net carbs based on carbs - fiber
- Updates database and refreshes page

#### Delete Functionality
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Removes food from database permanently

### 4. Features Implemented

#### Working Buttons
- **Add Food**: Opens modal to create new food entry
- **Edit**: Opens modal with current values for modification
- **Delete**: Removes food after confirmation
- **Favorite**: Toggle favorite status (already working)

#### Data Validation
- Required fields enforced in forms
- Numeric inputs with appropriate step values
- Automatic net carbs calculation

#### User Experience
- Success/error messages for all operations
- Page refresh after successful operations
- Confirmation before destructive actions

## Usage

### Adding a Food
1. Click "Add New Food" button
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Click "Save Food"

### Editing a Food
1. Click the yellow pencil button next to any food
2. Modify the values (note: food name and unit cannot be changed)
3. Click "Update Food"

### Deleting a Food
1. Click the red trash button next to any food
2. Confirm the deletion in the popup
3. Food is permanently removed

## Technical Notes

- The system uses the existing `FoodDatabase` class methods
- CSV format is used internally for data consistency
- Ingredient IDs are maintained for relationship integrity
- All operations require authentication

## Future Enhancements
- Bulk operations (delete multiple foods)
- Import/export functionality
- Nutrition label scanning integration
- Food grouping/categorization
