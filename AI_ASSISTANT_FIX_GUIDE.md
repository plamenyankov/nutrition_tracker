# AI Assistant State Management Fix

## Problem Description

There was a critical issue where the AI Assistant would sometimes save the wrong food data:
1. User analyzes Food A → Save fails
2. User analyzes Food B → When saving, it would save Food A instead of Food B

This happened because the AIService was using a singleton instance with shared state across all users and requests.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Session-Based Storage
- Replaced instance variable `self.temp_results` with session-based storage
- Each user gets their own unique session ID for storing analysis results
- Results are stored in Flask session instead of in-memory

### 2. Automatic Cleanup
- Each new analysis automatically clears previous results
- This prevents stale data from persisting
- Results are cleared even if an error occurs during analysis

### 3. Manual Clear Option
- Added a "Clear" button in the UI when results are displayed
- Users can manually clear results without running a new analysis
- Helpful for starting fresh or if something seems wrong

### 4. Better Error Messages
- Improved error messages to be more descriptive
- "No analysis results to save. Please analyze foods first." instead of generic errors

## How It Works Now

1. **Starting Analysis**: When user starts any type of analysis (text, photo, etc.), previous results are automatically cleared

2. **Storage**: Results are stored in the user's session with a unique key

3. **Saving**: When saving, the system retrieves results from the session, not from shared memory

4. **Clear Options**:
   - Automatic: New analysis clears old results
   - Manual: Clear button in UI
   - On Success: Results cleared after successful save or recipe creation

## User Benefits

- **Accuracy**: Always saves the correct food data
- **Transparency**: Clear button shows when data is present
- **Control**: Users can manually clear data anytime
- **Safety**: No cross-user data contamination

## Technical Details

### Session Configuration
```python
app.config['SESSION_PERMANENT'] = False
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = 3600  # 1 hour
```

### Storage Methods
- `_store_results()`: Saves analysis to session
- `_get_stored_results()`: Retrieves from session
- `_clear_stored_results()`: Removes from session

### UI Changes
- Added "Clear" button to results header
- Added tip about automatic clearing in help section
- Clear button shows warning icon and is colored yellow for visibility
